# YoutubeStatisticsGUI
Made with Python, the Youtube API, Tkinter, and Requests

This code uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI application that displays the number of views, subscribers, and videos for a specific YouTube channel. The code uses the YouTube Data API to fetch the statistics and displays them on the GUI. The code uses the requests library to make the API request and the json() method to parse the response. To run this code you need to get the api_key from the youtube developer console and get the channel_id of the channel you want to fetch the data from.
